            <p>Hey, I'm Ryan, I like game development! The most recent game I created was a game for an AP Computer Science Principles course, which was a platformer based off the hit game Castlevania. I am also interested in creating RPG video games, both singleplayer and multiplayer.</p>

            <p>my favorite games are creative ones and skill/strategy based ones, which is probably why some of my favorite games are minecraft and valorant. However, there are a lot of games that don't fit into these categories that I still love, such as pokemon.</p>
