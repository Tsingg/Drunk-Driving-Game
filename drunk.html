The idea of our game is one that will discourage drunk driving and teach people about the dangers of drunk driving. We will get the point across with a combination of a heart wrenching story and extremely infuriating gameplay that will make people want to quit alcohol forever. 
The game will use a controller similar to the steering wheel for Mario Kart Wii, as the player navigates a dystopian 2.5D world (2D, but like old legend of zelda games) while trying to complete missions that include driving to common places such as the grocery store, a friend's house, and school. However, this world is extremely addicted to alcohol, and a lot of the people on the road will be drunk drivers. You must use your reaction speed to dodge incoming cars and drunk people doing stupid things on the road. Messing up will show tragic scenes of funerals of all the people included in the car crash. Many of whom will have been met previously in the story and will have had enough personality that you feel bad about them dying. The reason why people drive everywhere instead of walk is because there are not a lot of sidewalks.
The Name is TBD
