Our game is meant to discourage people from driving drunk by showing them how easy it is to crash while being under the influence of alcohol. You play as a drunk driver with intentionally difficult controls. The reduction of control over speed and turning will cause the driver to crash their car a lot, providing the user with some statistics on how many fatal crashes involve drunk drivers.
The Name is TBD
